Add `Try it out` function like [swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/) on [redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).

## how to use?

``` html
<body>
  <div id="redoc-container"></div>
  <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc@2.0.0-rc.48/bundles/redoc.standalone.min.js"> </script>
  <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wll8/redoc-try@1.3.4/dist/try.js"></script>
  <script>
    initTry(`https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json`)
  </script>
</body>
```

## Options
When the parameter type is a string, the value is openApi.

When the parameter type is an object, you can configure the following:

``` js
initTry({
  openApi: `//petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json`, // openApi address
  // redocVersion: `2.0.0-rc.48`, // Used to handle compatibility issues, if not specified, read from the URL
  // onlySwagger: true,
  // tryText: `try`, // Try button text
  // trySwaggerInApi: true, // Whether to display swagger debugging window under api?
  // redocOptions: {enableConsole: true}, // Or the format is an array: `[specOrSpecUrl?, options?, element?, callback?]`
  // swaggerOptions: {dom_id: `#swagger-ui`},
  // authBtnPosSelector: `h1:eq(0)`, // jQuery selector of an element after that Authorize button will be added. header by default. 
  // authBtnText: `AUTHORIZE` // Authorize button text
})
```

## Why do you need it?

According to the description of [#53](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/issues/53#issuecomment-576377856), the try function is no longer developed, maybe it has become a paid function.

If you need to simply have this feature, you don't need to redevelop it, because it will consume a lot of time and lack community maintenance.

We chose to transplant Swagger's `Try it out` function, which is complete, has community maintenance, and is familiar.
